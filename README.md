# BizCardX ðŸ“‡

This repository showcases an end-to-end web application for extracting, managing, and maintaining business card information. Developed entirely by me, this project utilizes Google Generative AI (Gemini) for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and provides a comprehensive interface for real-time data handling through a Streamlit application.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to facilitate the extraction of business card details from uploaded images and manage these details effectively. The application processes business card images using the Google Generative AI (Gemini) API to extract relevant information and performs various database operations including saving, viewing, editing, and deleting records.

## Key Features

- **End-to-End Development**: Fully developed from image processing and data extraction to database management and web interface.
- **Google Generative AI Integration**: Utilizes the Gemini API for advanced OCR to extract detailed information from business card images.
- **Database Management**: Enables saving, viewing, editing, and deleting business card information in an SQLite database.
- **Interactive Web Application**: Streamlit-based app providing a user-friendly interface for business card management.

## Why Google Generative AI (Gemini)?

Google Generative AI (Gemini) was selected for its robust OCR capabilities, allowing for accurate extraction of text from images. This tool was essential in achieving high accuracy in extracting and processing business card details, ensuring reliable and actionable information.
